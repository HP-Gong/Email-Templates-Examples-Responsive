Email Templates Examples (Responsive) 
-------------------------------------
All of the email templates are created by the designer(s) from their Company.
I don't have the original designs to modify the images, so I modify the existing images to make it more even and easy to code.
I put the png file into photoshop and slice up the images and code the templates.
I attached the Templates PSD (modify) and other PSD files I used to code the templates.
The email templates are not TESTED on the any email marketing platform, everything is done offline.
To see any errors you will have to send out the TEST on the email marketing platform, open the browser and login to your email account to see any errors from each browsers

These are the languages and software I used for the email templates:

Language: HTML, CSS and Media Queries
Software: Photoshop and Dreamweaver
